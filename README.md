### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- ** kasunwanigasekara/kasunwanigasekara** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a software engineer with 6+ years of background in developing production and sales-based applications. I have a Software Engineering degree with 
second class upper division grade. recently I completed a PHP back-end development course at Jagaad Accedemy and from there got a chance to enhance 
my technological background in Symfony framework, Git, Docker, Object Oriented Programming, and REST API development. please check my projects which cover different 
aspects of my learnings and abilities in #software development.
